# Plan to Implement Incremental Changes in Ray.

To implement incremental computation in Ray, we can consider the following steps:
1. Enhance Dependency Tracking:
Current State:
Ray tracks task dependencies through ObjectIDs.
The ReferenceCounter and TaskDependencyManager manage dependencies and object references.
Dependencies are resolved before task execution, ensuring all inputs are available.
Implementation Plan:
Versioned Objects:
Introduce versioning for objects (data).
Assign a version number or timestamp to each ObjectID when it's created or updated.
Dependency Metadata:
Extend the TaskSpecification to include metadata about the version of each dependency.
Modify GetDependencyIds() and GetDependencies() to return versioned ObjectIDs.
2. Detect Changes in Dependencies:
Implementation Plan:
Change Detection Mechanism:
When an object is updated or a new version is created, notify dependent tasks about the change.
Use a publish-subscribe pattern where tasks subscribe to updates on their dependencies.
Update Propagation:
Propagate change notifications through the task graph.
Mark tasks that depend on changed objects as stale or needing re-execution.
3. Modify Task Scheduling and Execution:
Implementation Plan:
Incremental Task Re-execution:
Only re-execute tasks whose inputs have changed.
Cache the outputs of tasks along with the input versions they were computed from.
Task Memoization:
Implement memoization for deterministic tasks.
Before executing a task, check if a cached result exists for the current versions of its inputs.
Efficient Recomputations:
Optimize the scheduler to prioritize re-execution of tasks affected by changes.
Support partial recomputation in pipelines or workflows.
4. Update Object Store and Lineage Tracking:
Implementation Plan:
Object Store Enhancements:
Store multiple versions of objects or implement efficient update mechanisms (e.g., diffs).
Ensure that versioned objects are accessible and retrievable based on their versions.
Lineage Graph Modifications:
Extend the lineage graph to handle versioned objects and tasks.
Track the versions of objects used in task executions.
5. Implement Change Propagation Protocol:
Implementation Plan:
Protocol Design:
Define protocols for how changes in objects propagate through the system.
Ensure consistency and correctness in the presence of concurrent updates.
Conflict Resolution:
Handle cases where multiple updates occur simultaneously.
Decide on policies for conflict resolution (e.g., last-write wins, merge functions).
6. Testing and Validation:
Implementation Plan:
Unit Tests:
Write tests for the new components to ensure they work independently.
Integration Tests:
Test the entire system with incremental changes to verify end-to-end functionality.
Performance Benchmarking:
Measure the performance improvements from incremental computation.
Ensure that the overhead introduced by versioning and change detection is acceptable.
7. Update APIs and Documentation:
Implementation Plan:
User-facing APIs:
Provide APIs for users to define tasks that support incremental computation.
Allow users to specify when tasks should be re-executed based on input changes.
Documentation:
Update the Ray documentation to explain the new features.
Provide examples and best practices for using incremental computation.
---
Potential Challenges and Considerations:
Data Consistency: Ensuring that tasks see consistent versions of their inputs during execution.
Cache Management: Handling the storage and eviction of cached results to prevent excessive memory usage.
Complexity: Adding incremental computation increases the system's complexity, which may affect maintainability.
User Control: Providing users with control over which tasks should support incremental updates.
